**Artificial Intelligence: Contraint Satisfaction - Logic-game-Tenner-Grid-Solver**

#Two parts:#
1. Implementation of two constraint propagators: Foward Checking and Generalized Arc Consistency. 
   Found in propagators.py
2. Using the constraint propagators above in order to solve the logic puzzle, Tenner Grid.

#Solution#
The testings are run through the python files, "csp_sample_run" and "tenner_sample_run". The solutions
to all the sample problems can be found in the respective text files.
